			<h3>My Story So Far</h3>
			<div class="split-column">
				<p class="prompt">In two short, considered paragraphs, tell us who are you are and what you are good at.</p>
				<p class="answer">I am a thinker, one who is methodical and bold. I refrain from thinking outside of the box because that is potentially landing in someone else's box --- ouch! I am curious and inquisitive by nature. Like a giant pacific octopus stretching its tentacles in several directions, I do the same, just mindfully. I am self-dependent, actively looking for ways to stay ahead of the current.<br>
				I am good at bringing people up to speed. 'Did you know,' or 'did you hear about so-and-so,' could not sound more like me. The moment of discovery is another opportunity to learn something new, and I love that, whether it presents itself in my own research or first-hand experience. I am good at challenging myself and being proactive in the process. I dig, dig and will continue to dig until I am certain, beyond a doubt, that I know the subject material.

			<div class="split-column">
				<p class="prompt">Tell us how one place you have lived has influenced you.</p>
				<p class="answer">Madrid was one of the most exciting cultural experiences I have ever had. Eye-opening, for sure, and above all, influential. If I could summarize my time abroad in one word, it would be sonder. "The realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own." That definition spent four months living with me, among the <span class="italics">Madrileños</span>, attending the public university, eating rich, delicious food, and socializing with people from all walks of Spanish life. I was simultaneously a spectator and a participant in their everyday lives during the European economic crisis (Spain, in the early period of the recession, led the eurozone in unemployment), and it made me feel so annoyingly ignorant.<br>
				Up to that point I lived like one of the world's recluses, isolated from everyone's struggles, listening to my voice only. The world that I had known was gone when I returned home because I learned what it means to have perspective. It was a monumental shift in my thinking, and what I gained from it was worth so much more than late night <span class="italics">botellóns</span>, calm walks in <span class="italics">El Parque del Retiro</span> or home-cooked paellas.</p>

			<div class="split-column">
				<p class="prompt">What led you to the Brandcenter?</p>
				<p class="answer">The early stages of post-undergraduate life left me incredibly frustrated. I wandered aimlessly until my most recent job experience at a startup. Once I began creating content and designing ads for clients, I was convinced, wholly and surely, that this is it. Nothing prior to this experience resonated as strongly as this one. I felt so enveloped in the research and creative process, but I knew that if I wanted to create high quality work, I needed something else. So, I reached out to a Boston College alumnus, who currently works as a strategist for Wieden + Kennedy. He explained his role in the agency and what it takes to break into the advertising field. He also sent me a list of schools the agency recruits from and VCU is head and shoulders above other competing programs. His words, not mine.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="split-column">
				<p class="prompt">Tell us about a personal failure. Describe what happened and what you did about it. Distill the story into one paragraph.</p>
				<p class="answer">The task: pitch an idea for an original mobile app. Everyone rushed to make their final edits as the summer came to a close. Meanwhile, I stood back and watched the frenzy. We had assembled the strongest team, all equally competent in data mining, documenting research, presenting the important take-aways, and not to mention, our idea was awesome. We divided the work and rehearsed our parts until they were ingrained. No one saw the crash coming. Our team member left for school earlier than expected. Someone had to fill his absence and cover his part of the presentation. With no time to prepare (our team was the first one to present) we ran through the final project. It was like seeing the heavily favored sports team completely lose sight of its gameplan and blow the championship game. I wanted to point fingers and put the blame on our teammate. However, in retrospect, I realized that despite our great individual skills, we never came together as a synergistic, uniform team. It was the one group project that got away. And never again would I surrender myself to poor communication.</p>

			<div class="split-column">
				<p class="prompt">In one short paragraph convince the person reading your application that you have spent a respectful amount of time researching the track you are applying to and the work people in that track do when they graduate</p>
				<p class="answer">From what I understand, a strategist has an important role in an agency insofar as acting as the liaison between clients and creative. The work seems to be an independent act of balancing both the analytical and creative. Let's say, for example, Coca-Cola presented us with an objective: to sell more beverages to teenagers. A strategist has a breadth of responsibilities in this case, including conducting qualitative and quantitative research to gather consumer insight, composing creative briefs that inspire the team's ideation, planning and managing the timeline and results of the project, and effectively fostering the relationship between the client and agency.</p>
