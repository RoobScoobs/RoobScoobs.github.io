		<h1>Rube's Roman-Fleuve</h1>

		<h2>What is a Roman-Fleuve?</h2>

		<p>A <a href="http://www.britannica.com/art/roman-fleuve"> roman-fleuve</a> is defined as "a series of novels, each one complete in itself, that deal with one central character, an era of national life, or successive generations of a family." </p>

		<h2>You Are the Central Character</h2>

		<p>Let this be your literary watering hole. The story revolves around you after all. So unleash your creative thoughts, write infinitely, edit as much as your merry heart desires, and revel in the process (with or without drinking, your choice).</p>
