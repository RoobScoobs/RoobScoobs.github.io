				<h3>Interview Questions</h3>
				<p>Prior to conducting the interviews, I knew that I wanted to arrive at a conclusion inductively. There might be some truth to the conclusion, however, it cannot be certain. After all, the sample size is quite small. Also, I was interested in learning if fit stumps brand equity among young consumers. In other words, do consumers first buy into the product or the name behind the product. The questions, therefore, are structured in such a general way that the responses can affirm or negate the hypothesis in mind or lend support to another conclusion.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What is the style/cut of your jeans?</li>
					<li>Can you describe how it fits?</li>
					<li>What brand is the jeans?</li>
					<li>Did you the brand have any influence when you first purchased the jeans?</li>
					<li id="yes">If answered yes, what about the brand made you want to purchase the pair of jeans?</li>
					<li id="no">If answered no, what mattered most to you when you were about to buy the jeans?</li>
					<li>What do you like most about this pair?</li>
					<li>What do you dislike the most?</li>
					<li>How do you feel in those jeans?</li>
					<li>How is that feeling distinct from other jeans you put on?</li>
					<li>Would you change anything about your jeans?</li>
					<li>How do you decide when to wear this pair of jeans?</li>

				<h3>As the US population becomes more and more multicultural and more global, why does the "international aisle" still exist in major grocery store chains?</h3>
				<p>Before answering the question, let's define and set the context around the key phrase: major grocery store chains. Based on annual revenue, the three <a href="http://retailindustry.about.com/od/us-supermarket-grocery-stores/fl/Worldrsquos-Largest-US-Based-Retail-Grocery-and-Supermarket-Chains-2015_2.htm"> largest U.S. based grocery store chains</a> include The Kroger Company (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/kr/financials">108.47B</a>), Albertsons (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/albertsons/">57.5B</a>) and Publix Super Markets (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/publix-super-markets/">30.6B</a>).<br>What all three companies have in common is their market positioning - right in the middle - which allows them to meet the mass needs of the U.S. population. Neither specializing in premium fresh products or low discounted prices, these grocers are especially successful in reining in a diverse shopper base that is spread across education and income levels.<br>Although it is clear that modern food culture has undergone a sort of spirited revival, one that <a href="http://www.fmi.org/docs/default-source/research/presentation.pdf?sfvrsn=0">breaks away from traditional values</a> (e.g. societal roles, hierarchy, class-based identity and basic needs), the "international aisle" remains where it has always been because that is where consumers are used to looking. When grocery store chains have achieved scale, implementing changes, especially categorical ones, will always take cautionary steps so as not to dissatisfy a particular group of shoppers or make the shopping experience any more difficult.<br>Yes, the U.S. population is becoming more culturally heterogeneous, however, that burgeoning change has not yet reached a pivotal turning point. Think about which segment of the population is even aware of the changes in our food culture: the younger, well educated, social media savvy generation. This demographic (anyone born between 1980 and 2000), commonly termed as millennials or generation Y, is now becoming <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21660110-businesses-should-beware-dubious-generalisations-about-younger-workers-myths-about">America's largest workforce</a> and accruing enough disposable income to do their own food shopping.<br>Millennials exemplify the <a href="http://www.fmi.org/docs/default-source/research/presentation.pdf?sfvrsn=0">fragmentation in our food culture</a>. They emphasize choice, exploring different channels of communication, expressing their identities via meals and diets, and eating wherever and whenever they want. The most dominant supermarkets and grocery store chains refrain from changing the arrangment and display of certain foods because that is only one constituent of the whole market.<br>Also, take into consideration how "<a href="http://www.fmi.org/docs/default-source/research/presentation.pdf?sfvrsn=0">today's eating and shopping behaviors are inexorably linked.</a>" In other words, the way in which we eat is akin to the way in which we shop. For example, a very common theme for dinners is taco night, a result of our multicultural acceptance, and so after having decided what to eat, it becomes evident where to look for the essential ingredients, the international aisle.</p>

				<h3>What does Jimmy Fallon know about using social media that brands should know?</h3>
				<p>Jimmy Fallon has really leveraged the power of social media. There are some important concepts to note following his example. Firstly, Late Night With Jimmy Fallon is perfectly compatible with social media platforms. In other words, because the show is segmented (e.g. monologue, interviews and performances), it can be edited in such a way that users can access the best moments of the show -- from the punchlines in sketches to the hook of an artist's performance and the hilarious activities between guest and host.<br>It is an important concept to understand because it is added value to the user. Every brand should be asking themselves: how do we neatly package our content so that it is social media friendly? They have a finite amount of time to work with. The more 'digestible' a brand's content, chances are, the more success they will have on social media.<br>Secondly, the show provides a consistent stream of high quality content that is attune to virality. At the end of the day, it helps that he is on a show that takes on relevant, humorous critiques of our society, people and culture. But, then again, you will not find a step-by-step guide for what makes viral content. I cannot tell you how many times I have seen lip sync battles trending on Twitter.<br>This ties into not only how content is packaged but also how it is delivered and managed. Brands should consider a number of items before exporting their content: when should uploads be scheduled, does the copy make sense for the audience, does it grab their attention and compel them to view, like, comment and share. Just because you have planted the seed, it does not mean you can walk away and watch your tree grow. Content should be approached in the same way. It can only do so much on its own. Managing its deliverance is key.<br>Thirdly, we cannot overlook the fact that this is also about Jimmy Fallon, not just Late Night. He is a personality, an incredibly well known comedic who successfully transitioned to having an eponymous show on late night television. His social media presence obviously necessitates ubiquity, and that requires an integrated approach to content, but that does not mean delivering the same packaged goods across every channel. He plays into each network's strengths, curating specific content that is appropriate for each channel. It is likely you will not see photos of a family trip on Twitter, although it is not entirely out of the question, but, surely, that is more appropriate for Instagram.<br>The takeaway here is that brands have the option to present themselves as holistically as possible, giving their consumers a clear picture of the people behind the work. Such transparency can foster a relationship characterized by intense loyalty. Look at Steve Jobs -- the dude had two posthumous biopics made, and he is all but hailed as a demigod by fervent Apple consumers.</p>

				<h3>You are the head of strategy at an agency that has been asked to pitch Vitamin Water. Describe three hypotheses you would have your team explore to ensure Vitamin Water gains a bigger share of the enhanced water beverage segment.</h3>
				<p>As consumers become more health conscious, they are opting for less carbonated, sugary drinks, wary of the adverse effects of consuming too much added sugar.</p>
				<p class="quote">"<a href="http://blog.marketresearch.com/health-trends-drive-growth-of-u.s.-bottled-water-market-creativity-spikes-sales">Over the last decade, the number of adults who drank five or more bottles of water grew more than 20%, while the number of adults who drank five or more glasses of diet cola, regular cola, and other carbonated diet drinks fell by double-digit percentages.</a>"</p>
				<p>The Vitamin Water product line, with the exception of the Zero line, consists of crystalline fructose, which, if consumed excessively, can overload the liver and trigger high levels of fat storage in the body. This is not a question of how do we get current consumers to drink more Vitamin Water, but rather how do we capture those who are not.<br>How can we achieve that? <span>Hypothesis number one: shifting the perception away from sugar to the quality of vitamins.</span> If consumer awareness on the harmful effects of excessive sugar is widespread, there should be an equally compensatory force on the benefits of the supplied vitamins. Do you think the average consumer knows what health benefits are derived from B12? This is about emphasizing the 'Vitamin' of Vitamin Water -- real nutrition, not hype.<br>The <a href="http://vitaminwater.tumblr.com/">current campaign</a> associates hustle -- which is precisely the word they use -- with Vitamin Water. It marks a bit of a departure from being positioned solely as a sports drink, as early promotions underlined such a viewpoint by endorsing athletes. Although the "hustle" campaign is not exclusively directed at a sports population, the agenda needs to be pushed even further. <span>Hypothesis number two: make use of the diverse product line to convey the needs of segments of the population that is not drinking Vitamin Water</span>. Each product contains a combination of nutrients that delivers a functional benefit to the consumer. As an active lifestyle brand, Vitamin Water should recognize that even if you are hustling or not, hydration is universal, a must for everyone.<br>Vitamin Water already reflects a broader culinary trend insofar as offering distinct and bold flavors. What if it were possible to tap into another emerging trend in the bottled water industry? <span>Hypothesis number three: transforming enhanced water into a fashion accessory by bridging the ideal of good health and wellness with high-end aesthetics</span>. It is a bridge worth building, given that the world of fashion complements the <a href="http://www.integratedbrands.org/brands/vitamin-water/@@details">brand's identity</a> as a beacon of natural health and inspiration.</p>

				<h3>Choose a story from the Sunday New York Times opinion section and then explain why: 1) you agree with it or 2) you agree and would add the following proof points or 3) you disagree completely and why.</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/opinion/the-nfls-next-play-address-brain-trauma-or-fade-away.html?ref=opinion&_r=0">I agree with the author</a> on many points: yes, it is appalling to see vicious tackles go unpunished or result in underwhelming fines and suspensions; yes, the emerging evidence on CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) leaves the N.F.L. in vulnerable legal territory; and yes, the league should implement changes that protects players from receiving debilitating head trauma.<br>However, the concluding remarks made by George D. Lundberg left me a bit skeptical. If "inaction by the owners and commissioner of the N.F.L." continues, then the sport of football will follow a similar path as Professional boxing, spiraling downward and extinguishing the bright flame that most of America sits down to watch on Sundays. I believe -- for the same reasons that Lundberg writes as to why he will not call for the abolition of the sport -- it is hard to compare the trajectory of a violent individual sport to that of a colossal entity, which is so firmly embedded in today's culture. Boxing had social value, as Lundberg writes, but it never came close to the transcendental value of American football.</p>
